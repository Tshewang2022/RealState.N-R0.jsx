Real state fontend project created base on the react.js
This porject created using React.js
The basic flow of the react.js, react project can be created using the two process
  1. using the create React app(CRA)
  2. using vite( npm create vite@4.1.0)
Where i have used vite to create my project and used nmp to install the package, yarn to run the project
To run the project using the yarn, we use yarn run dev
Using the vite is much more faster and more convenient
